Alternatively you can download the code, type `npm install` and run it locally.

I decided to log the results to the console to make it as clear as possible what is returned by the code. What could be improved:

-   The `main.ts` file that manages which code to run could use some cleaning but it gets the job done given the instructions.
-   If this was a more complex project implementing a custom data fetching solution like `Tanstack Query` would be a good idea.

**Technologies used:**

-   Typescript
-   HTML & CSS
-   Vite
-   Vitest
-   Eslint
-   Prettier

Please note that (at least in my case) the github pages preview doesn't seem to work correctly when adblock is enabled for the page. So if you encounter any weird bugs then turing off adblock may help.
